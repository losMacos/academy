## Solidity Fundamental Side Drawers for Lesson 3

### constant/immutable

#### constant 
The `constant` keyword in Solidity is reserved for state variables and functions. The immutable nature of smart contracts is preserved by the state variables defined as **constant** to ensure that values assigned at compile time cannot be modified at runtime. Blockchain data such as `now, msg.value, block.number, or msg.sender` cannot be used as state variables because theses values are continually changing. There are other functions such as `keccak256, ecrecover, and sha256` that can be used with the `constant` keyword. 

#### immutable
Variables declared as immutable are a bit less restricted than those declared as constant: Immutable variables can be assigned an arbitrary value in the constructor of the contract or at the point of their declaration. They cannot be read during construction time and can only be assigned once.
The contract creation code generated by the compiler will modify the contractâ€™s runtime code before it is returned by replacing all references to immutables by the values assigned to the them. This is important if you are comparing the runtime code generated by the compiler with the one actually stored in the blockchain.(https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.5/contracts.html#immutable)


### mint function
    - Same as Lesson 2




### payable functions
    - msg.value




### balances





### withdraw functions
    - Ownable / onlyOwner
    - sending ether (call vs. send vs. transfer)
